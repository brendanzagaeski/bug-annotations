# bug-annotations

## Steps to add a bug

1. Copy and paste the contents of [`_template.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanzagaeski/bug-annotations/gh-pages/_bugs/_template.md) into a new file under the "[_bugs/](https://github.com/brendanzagaeski/bug-annotations/tree/gh-pages/_bugs)" folder. Make sure to name the new file carefully with the bug number of the corresponding bug in Bugzilla.

2. Follow the descriptions in the comments in `_template.md` to fill out the various bug fields by copy-pasting from Bugzilla or creating your own new annotations. Most of the fields are optional (in fact you can even add an empty file and the bug number will appear in the bug list), but the more information the better, especially to help with filtering.
