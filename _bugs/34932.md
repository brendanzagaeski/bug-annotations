summaryMarkdown: >
    If the Mac build host is connected to a router that has not access to the internet (or another DNS server that times out during the reverse-DNS lookup of the Windows PC), then Visual Studio will take roughly 30 seconds to retrieve the SSH fingerprint, and eventually fail to connect. The dialog error and the "Output -> Xamarin" Window will show the _generic_ error message: "Couldn't connect to ... Please try again."
workaroundMarkdown: |
    **Possible workaround**, only recommended for users who know what this configuration change does: Add the following line to `/etc/sshd_config`:  
    `UseDNS no`
