    > The application XXXXXX needs to be rebuilt due to an inconsistency between the connected Mac and the local app. Please rebuild the application and try again.

    This error is _expected_ after upgrading from Xamarin 3 to Xamarin 4 until a clean build is performed.
    
    **Steps that would in theory be expected to stop the problem** (but might fail as reported in Bug 35956): 
    
    1. Clean the project while connected to the build host.
    2. Manually delete the `bin\` and `obj\` folders on Windows and the `$HOME/Library/Caches/Xamarin/mtbs` folder on Mac.
    3. Manually remove any previously installed versions of the app from the device (or use the "Simulator -> Reset Content and Settings" menu item if running on a simulator).

workaroundMarkdown: |
    **Possible partial workarounds** in case those steps fail:
    
    - Explicitly disconnecting and reconnecting the Mac build host [has been reported to help in one case](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/165853/#Comment_165853).

    - Another possible (though inconvenient) workaround from [that same forum thread](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/56054/the-application-xxx-needs-to-be-rebuilt-due-to-an-inconsistency) is to:

        1. Create a new project, and then re-import all of the existing resources and files from the old project.
        2. Build the project on the command line using MSBuild.
        3. Debug the app from Visual Studio (without rebuilding).
