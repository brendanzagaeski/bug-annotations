workaround: >
    **Workaround**: This issue does _not_ affect Xamarin.iOS 9.0, so one possible temporary workaround is to [downgrade Xcode](https://kb.xamarin.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2024338-how-can-i-downgrade-xcode-) to 7.0 and [downgrade Xamarin.iOS](https://kb.xamarin.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1699777-how-do-i-downgrade-to-an-older-version-of-xamarin-) to 9.0.
