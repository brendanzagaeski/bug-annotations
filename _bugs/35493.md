    "Invalid WatchKit Support - The bundle contains an invalid implementation of WatchKit. The app may have been built or signed with non-compliant or pre-release tools." when attempting to submit a WatchKit (watchOS 1) app to the App Store. This issue is under active investigation for a fix.
workaround: >
    **Workaround**: This issue does _not_ affect Xamarin.iOS 9.0, so one possible temporary workaround is to [downgrade Xcode](https://kb.xamarin.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2024338-how-can-i-downgrade-xcode-) to 7.0 and [downgrade Xamarin.iOS](https://kb.xamarin.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1699777-how-do-i-downgrade-to-an-older-version-of-xamarin-) to 9.0.
