summaryMarkdown: |
    "Invalid credentials. Please try again." when attempting to log into the build host using an account "Full name" that includes an accented character. This appears to be a limitation of the [SSH.NET library](https://sshnet.codeplex.com/).

workaroundMarkdown: |
    **Workaround**: Use the "Account name" instead ("testuser" rather than "Test Usér" in this example). One way to find the "Account name" is to Control-click the user name in "System Preferences -> User & Groups" and select "Advanced Options".

statusNotesMarkdown: |
    No changes planned. Please use the "Account name" to log in as described in the Workaround.
